If it is possible for you to share your hypothesis or results, I am quite interested!  My email is 5be4af2d8306570001933076@email.prolific.com","passed","passed"

"e070cf95-413d-4d96-b703-2b597bd9bfc6","It was a tad difficult to differentiate between the options provided. A lot of those statements could have been perceived as a lack of communication due to the task being completed (i.e. balloon popping but not telling anyone, etc) or the task being left incomplete (i.e. the vase did not break so the person smiled), so I would suggest this be at the interpretation of the individual taking the survey.","passed","passed"
